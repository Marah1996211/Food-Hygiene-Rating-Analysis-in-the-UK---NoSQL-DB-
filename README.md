This project involved analyzing food hygiene ratings data from the UK Food Standards Agency for the food magazine Eat Safe, Love. The project was structured in three parts:

##Database Setup: 
The initial task was to import data from the provided establishments.json file into a MongoDB database named uk_food, ensuring proper setup and data integrity. Key actions included verifying the database and collection, displaying a sample document, and preparing the database for further analysis.

##Database Updates: 
Several updates were made to the database based on the magazine editors' requests. These included adding a new halal restaurant, updating its business type, removing data for establishments in Dover, and converting specific fields to the correct data types, such as latitude, longitude, and rating values.

##Exploratory Analysis:
In this phase, the goal was to analyze the data and answer specific questions posed by the magazine editors, such as identifying establishments with a hygiene score of 20, finding those with high ratings in London, and locating the top 5 establishments near the newly added restaurant. The analysis utilized MongoDB queries, aggregation pipelines, and Pandas for data manipulation and presentation.

This project allowed for hands-on experience with MongoDB, data transformation, and exploratory data analysis using Python.
